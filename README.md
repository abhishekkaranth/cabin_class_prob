# fare_choice_probability_predictor
A machine learning model to predict the probability of each of the different fare choices available to a airline passenger based on features such as Booking Date, Departure Date, Departure Time, Origin, Destination, No. of passengers.
A passenger has different options when it comes to booking a flight ticket. It can be classic fare(no scope for cancellation), saver fare(discounted fare), flexible fare(scope for cancellation) etc.
Predicting this demand correctly before hand can give airlines advantages in maximizing its revenue and also better plan the fare distribution.

- The categories present Orgin, Destination and Fare choice columns are encoded to maintain confidentiality.
- The notebook involves EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering, Model Building (Random Forest), Hyper parameter tuning and finally Evaluation of the model.
